**Project Structure:**
   ```bash
   SQL_Playground/
  ├── ERD.png
  ├── schema.sql
  ├── operations-analysis.sql
  ├── README.md

This structure clearly shows the files included in your project:

    ERD.png: The Entity-Relationship Diagram.
    schema.sql: The script for creating the database schema and inserting data.
    operations-analysis.sql: The file containing your SQL exercises and data analysis queries.
    README.md: The project's documentation file.

This structure is easy to understand and maintain. You can further organize the operations-analysis.sql file by adding comments and separating different types of exercises into sections.

I hope this enhanced structure and README file make your repository even more organized and user-friendly!
